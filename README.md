# Post Creator

Back in the day, I was searching for a post creation tool for an Instagram page. While options like Figma, Canva, Photopea, and Pixlr were available, they weren't the thing I was looking for. So, I decided to create a very basic creator to make my life easier, yk.

## Running Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `yarn`.
3. Run the project using `yarn start`.

> Alternatively, you can deploy the project to the cloud using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com). They're free and easy to use platforms.
