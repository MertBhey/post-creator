# Basic Directory Explanation: What's This?
We have this folder to keep our font files, wow.

# Adding a font
1. Put the font in this directory
2. Add the font to the `<style>` tag in `index.html` file (root directory)
    - You can ~~yell at ChatGPT~~ ask nicely to ChatGPT if you don't know how css works (like me)
3. Commit and push your changes ðŸŽ‰

> You may need to reload the page few times after loading the font for the first time.
